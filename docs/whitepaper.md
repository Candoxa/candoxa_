## 1. Manifesto — The Age of Recognition
The internet captures but rarely preserves. Candoxa addresses this by introducing the **memory layer of the internet**, ensuring that meaningful contributions are not lost in endless feeds.

**Core Values:**  
- Authenticity — recognizing substance over noise  
- Transparency — ensuring clarity and trust in recognition  
- Community Empowerment — amplifying every voice equally  
- Innovation — merging Web2 ease with Web3 permanence  
- Fairness — anti-bot, anti-spam, quality-first ecosystem  

---

## 2. Founder Vision — Why It Had to Be a Blockchain
Candoxa was born out of the silence of erased voices. Unlike Web2 platforms, blockchain technology ensures contributions are **verifiable, permanent, and transparent**.  

A Layer 1 blockchain was necessary to:  
- Hold and verify opinion activations  
- Gift recognition transparently  
- Provide a cultural record beyond any single platform  

---

## 3. The Doxa System
Candoxa transforms digital actions into **opinion activations**.

### 3.1 Opinion Activation Rules
- One activation per platform per Doxa  
- Multiple platforms allow multiple activations  
- Switching activations is allowed but tracked  

### 3.2 Spam Prevention & Integrity
- Daily caps, engagement scoring, manual moderation  
- Originality filters, bot detection, rising stars leaderboard, milestone tags  

### 3.3 Gifting Formula
Projects define recognition logic using:  
- Engagement quality  
- Platform-specific metrics  
- Testnet interaction  
- Bonus factors like referrals and consistency  

### 3.4 Testnet-Based Multipliers
Formula:  
`Final Doxa = Earned Doxa × (Testnet Score ÷ 1,000)`  

Example: `5 Doxa × (5,000 ÷ 1,000) = 25 Doxa`

## 4. Legacy Recognition

### 4.1 Doxarian Badges
- Non-transferable trust signals  
- Unlock governance rights, early access, and gated activations  

### 4.2 DOXA NFTs
- Timestamped on-chain records  
- Stored on IPFS/Arweave  
- Usable across DAOs, grants, and digital profiles  

### 4.3 Cultural & Long-Term Value
These digital heirlooms may serve as family legacies, cultural archives, and trust signals across future platforms.  

---

## 5. The Memory Layer System

### 5.1 What Memory Means
Selective preservation of signals that matter most.  

### 5.2 Culture as Contribution
- Music: protest songs, community tracks

### 5.3 Web2 Beyond Social
Recognizing contributions from platforms like Coursera, Zendesk, Etsy, GitHub, and Notion.  

### 5.4 What We’ll Remember
Cultural, social, and educational milestones stored as Memory Proofs.  

---

## 6. Memory Capture & Platform Connection

### 6.1 Memory Capture Process
- Opt-in via OAuth or wallet linking  
- Contributors select meaningful signals  

### 6.2 Platform Connections
