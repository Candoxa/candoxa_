# About Us

**Candoxa** is the world’s first **blockchain global memory layer.**  
We preserve digital presence by transforming every opinion, signal, and activation into permanent, verifiable **Memory Proofs.**

Unlike chains that only record tokens, Candoxa records **culture, voices, and presence.** Every Doxa (contributor) is remembered, every opinion activated becomes part of history, and every gift recognizes authentic engagement.

## Our Story
Candoxa was founded by **Kavod (Vision Lead)** and **Rhodah (Community Lead).**

- Kavod is the founder of GodMCee Media, known for leading campaigns for artists, brands, and political figures. In Web3, his vision has shaped narratives and communities across DeFi and social protocols.  
- Rhodah is the founder of JogNetwork, a Web3 community that onboarded thousands. She is a strategist in ecosystem growth and engagement, ensuring Candoxa’s culture is as strong as its technology.  

Together, they bring decades of experience in **marketing, storytelling, and community architecture** — building Candoxa not just as a chain, but as a living movement.
